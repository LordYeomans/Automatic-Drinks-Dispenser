## Automatic Drinks Dispenser
The use of a Graphical Liquid Crystal Display (GLCD) and pumps are able to pour drinks with a tap from the screen. Two options of drinks (water & apple juice) can be poured via an air pump connected to 4mm tubing to dispense the drink into a glass. Liquid level sensors are able to detect the current amount of liquid in each container, turning on a red LED when no liquid is detected. 

## Components Used
1, GLCD Touchscreen (STM32F746NG)  
2, 12V air pumps (PYP370-12Z)
