The \"{}\+Automatic Drinks Dispenser\"{} is able to dispense two liquids into a glass with a push of a button from the Graphical Liquid Crystal Display (GLCD). Drinks are poured via air pumps connected to 4mm flexible PVC tubing. The liquids are stored in two separate plastic bottles acting as reservoirs, where a red 5mm LED is turned on when the liquid reaches a certain threshold. The LED indicates the liquid needs to replenished, to ensure users can receive the correct amount of liquid. Once the liquid has been successfully poured, the piezo buzzer is turned on for 1 second to signal this. To protect the electronics and stored liquids against the elements, the dispenser is enclosed in 12mm thick MDF with access to the back, hiding the wires and electronics from users.
